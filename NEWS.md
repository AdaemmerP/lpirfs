# lpirfs 0.1.1
* The dependency to the *mFilter* package is removed.  The HP-filter is now written in C++ which 
vastly improves efficiency. The function is exported and can thus be used for any purpose. 

* A problem with a C++ function is resolved so that the package can also be installed on Oracle Solaris. 

# lpirfs 0.1.9000
* This is the development version. 

# lpirfs 0.1.0
* Preparation for CRAN release.
