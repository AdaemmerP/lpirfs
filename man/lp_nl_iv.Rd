\usage{
lp_nl_iv(endog_data, lags_endog_nl = NULL, shock = NULL,
  instr = NULL, exog_data = NULL, lags_exog = NULL,
  contemp_data = NULL, lags_criterion = NULL, max_lags = NULL,
  trend = NULL, confint = NULL, hor = NULL, switching = NULL,
  use_hp = NULL, lambda = NULL, gamma = NULL, num_cores = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{endog_data}{A \link{data.frame}, containing all endogenous variables for the VAR. The column order
is used for the Cholesky decomposition.}

\item{lags_endog_nl}{NaN or integer. Number of lags for nonlinear VAR. NaN if lag length criterion is given.}

\item{shock}{One column \link{data.frame}, including the instrument to shock with.
The row length has to be the same as \emph{endog_data}.}

\item{instr}{Deprecated input name. Use \emph{shock} instead. See \emph{shock} for details.}

\item{exog_data}{A \link{data.frame}, containing exogenous variables for the VAR. The row length has to be the same as \emph{endog_data}.
Lag lengths for exogenous variables have to be given and will no be determined via a lag length criterion.}

\item{lags_exog}{Null or an integer, indicating the number of lags for exogenous data.}

\item{contemp_data}{A \link{data.frame}, containing exogenous data with contemporaneous impact. This data will not be lagged.
The row length has to be the same as \emph{endog_data}.}

\item{lags_criterion}{NaN or character. NaN means that the number of lags
will be given at \emph{lags_endog_nl} and \emph{lags_lin}. The lag length criteria are 'AICc', 'AIC' and 'BIC'.}

\item{max_lags}{NaN or integer. Maximum number of lags (if \emph{lags_criterion} = 'AICc', 'AIC', 'BIC'). NaN otherwise.}

\item{trend}{Integer. Include no trend =  0 , include trend = 1, include trend and quadratic trend = 2.}

\item{confint}{Double. Width of confidence bands. 68\% = 1; 90\% = 1.65; 95\% = 1.96.}

\item{hor}{Integer. Number of horizons for impulse responses.}

\item{switching}{Numeric vector. A column vector with the same length as \emph{endog_data}. This series can either
be decomposed via the Hodrick-Prescott filter (see Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2013) or
directly plugged into the following smooth transition function:
\deqn{ F_{z_t} = \frac{exp(-\gamma z_t)}{1 + exp(-\gamma z_t)}. }
Warning: \eqn{F_{z_t}} will be lagged by one and then multiplied with the data.
If the variable shall not be lagged, the vector has to be given with a lead of one.
The data for the two regimes are: \cr
Regime 1 = (1-\eqn{F(z_{t-1})})*y_{(t-p)}, \cr
Regime 2 = \eqn{F(z_{t-1})}*y_{(t-p)}.}

\item{use_hp}{Boolean. Use HP-filter? TRUE or FALSE.}

\item{lambda}{Double. Value of \eqn{\lambda} for the Hodrick-Prescott filter (if use_hp = TRUE).}

\item{gamma}{Double. Positive number which is used in the transition function.}

\item{num_cores}{Integer. The number of cores to use for the estimation. If NULL, the function will
use the maximum number of cores minus one.}
}
\value{
A list containing:

\item{irf_s1_mean}{A \link{matrix}, containing the impulse responses of the first regime.
                   The row in each matrix denotes the responses of the \emph{ith}
                   variable to the shock. The columns are the horizons.}

\item{irf_s1_low}{A \link{matrix}, containing all lower confidence bands of
                   the impulse responses, based on robust standard errors by Newey and West (1987).
                   Properties are equal to \emph{irf_s1_mean}.}

\item{irf_s1_up}{A \link{matrix}, containing all upper confidence bands of the
                   impulse responses, based on robust standard errors by Newey and West (1987).
                   Properties are equal to \emph{irf_s1_mean}.}

\item{irf_s2_mean}{A \link{matrix}, containing all impulse responses for the second regime.
                   The row in each matrix denotes the responses of the \emph{ith} variable to the shock.
                   The columns denote the horizon.}

\item{irf_s2_low}{A \link{matrix}, containing all lower confidence bands of the responses,
                   based on robust standard errors by Newey and West (1987). Properties are equal to \emph{irf_s2_mean}.}

\item{irf_s2_up}{A \link{matrix}, containing all upper confidence bands of the responses, based on
                   robust standard errors by Newey and West (1987). Properties are equal to \emph{irf_s2_mean}.}

\item{specs}{A list with properties of \emph{endog_data} for the plot function. It also contains
            lagged data (y_nl and x_nl) used for the estimations of the impulse responses}

\item{fz}{A vector, containing the values of the transition function F(z_{t-1}).}
