# About
An R-package which estimates linear and nonlinear impulse responses
with local projections by [Jordà (2005)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828518).

## Main features

- Estimates linear and nonlinear impulse responses with local projections.
- Functions to plot linear and nonlinear impulse responses.
- Functions are partly implemented in *Rcpp* and *RcppArmadillo* to improve efficiency.
- High performance with parallel computation.



## Examples
Examples can be found [here.](https://adaemmerp.github.io/lpirfs/README_docs.html)


## Installation

You can install the released version of **lpirfs** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lpirfs")
```

You can install the development version of **lpirfs** from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AdaemmerP/lpirfs")
```

The package compiles some C++ source code for installation, which is why you need the appropriate compilers:

On Windows you need [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) available from CRAN. 

On macOS you need the Clang 6.x compiler and the GNU Fortran compiler from [macOS tools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/).
Having installed the compilers, you need to open a terminal and start R via 'PATH=/usr/local/clang6/bin:$PATH R'. 
Yo can then install the package via *devtools::install_github("AdaemmerP/lpirfs")*


## Acknowledgements
I greatly benefit from the profound *R*, *Rcpp* and *GitHub* knowledge of Philipp [Wittenberg](https://github.com/wittenberg) and Detlef (overflow) [Steuer](https://github.com/dsteuer). Remaining errors are obviously mine. 

## Development
I intend to extend the package with functions that

* allow to manually identify the linear combinations of the reduced form residuals,
* allow to include exogenous variables,
* conduct IV-lp estimation,
* conduct panel-lp estimation.
