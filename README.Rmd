# About
An R-package which estimates linear and nonlinear impulse responses
with local projections by [Jordà (2005)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828518).

## Main features

- Estimates linear and nonlinear impulse responses with local projections.
- Estimates linear and nonlinear impulse responses with local projections and
  instrument variables (development version).
- Functions to plot linear and nonlinear impulse responses.
- Functions are partly implemented in *Rcpp* and *RcppArmadillo* to improve efficiency.
- High performance with parallel computation.

## Updates and new features in the development version 
* Fixed an error in *lp_nl* when the number of lags is chosen by a lag length criterion. 
  The version on CRAN (0.1.1) chooses lags based on linear data instead of
  nonlinear lagged data.

* All functions now allow to include (lagged) exogenous data and data 
  with contemporaneous impact. 

* Two new functions allow to estimate 
  linear (*lp_lin_iv*) and nonlinear (*lp_nl_iv*) impulse responses with local projections 
  via instrument variables as in, 
  e.g., [Ramey and Zubairy (2018)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/696277).
  
* All functions now allow to manually choose the number of cores.

* Some input names in *lp_lin* and *lp_nl* have been changed for consistency:

function | old input name | new input name
:--------|:-------------  |:------------- 
`lp_lin` | `lags_lin`     | `lags_endog_lin`
`lp_nl`  | `lags_lin`     | `lags_endog_lin`
`lp_nl`  | `lags_nl`      | `lags_endog_nl`
`lp_nl`  | `hp_filter`    | `use_hp`




## Examples
Examples can be found [here.](https://adaemmerp.github.io/lpirfs/README_docs.html)


## Installation

You can install the released version (0.1.1) of **lpirfs** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lpirfs")
```

You can install the development version of **lpirfs** from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AdaemmerP/lpirfs")
```

The package compiles some C++ source code for installation, which is why you need the appropriate compilers:

On Windows you need [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) available from CRAN. 

On macOS you need the Clang 6.x compiler and the GNU Fortran compiler from [macOS tools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/).
Having installed the compilers, you need to open a terminal and start R via 'PATH=/usr/local/clang6/bin:$PATH R'. 
Yo can then install the package via *devtools::install_github("AdaemmerP/lpirfs")*


## Acknowledgements
I am thankful to Òscar [Jordà](https://sites.google.com/site/oscarjorda/) for encouraging comments and helpful suggestions. I am also indebted to Sarah [Zubairy](https://sites.google.com/site/sarahzubairy/) for providing the Matlab code before the publication of their 
[paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/696277). 

I greatly benefit from the profound *R*, *Rcpp* and *GitHub* knowledge of Philipp [Wittenberg](https://github.com/wittenberg) and Detlef (overflow) [Steuer](https://github.com/dsteuer).
Last but not least, I am grateful to Philipp Dybowski for his rigorous comments and without whom I would have 
never started this project.

All remaining errors are obviously mine. 

## Development
I intend to further extend the package with functions that

* allow to manually identify the linear combinations of the reduced form residuals,
* conduct panel-lp estimation.
