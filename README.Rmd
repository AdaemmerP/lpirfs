## About
An R-package which estimates linear and nonlinear impulse responses
with local projections by [Jordà (2005)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828518).<br />

## Citation
Please cite the paper by  [Adämmer (2019)](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019/RJ-2019-052/index.html)
when using the package.

## Main features

- Estimates linear and nonlinear impulse responses with local projections.
- Estimates linear and nonlinear impulse responses with identified shock and/or with 2SLS.
- Estimates linear and nonlinear impulse responses with local projections for panel data.
- Functions to plot linear and nonlinear impulse responses.
- Functions are partly implemented in *Rcpp*/*RcppArmadillo* and partly written for parallel computation
  to improve efficiency.


## Installation

You can install the released version of **lpirfs** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org):

``` r
install.packages("lpirfs")
```

You can install the development version of **lpirfs** from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/AdaemmerP/lpirfs/tree/dev")
```

As lpirfs compiles some C++ source code, you will need to have installed the appropriate compilers to build the development version.

## Acknowledgements
I am thankful to Òscar [Jordà](https://sites.google.com/site/oscarjorda/) for encouraging comments and helpful suggestions. I am also indebted to Sarah [Zubairy](https://sites.google.com/site/sarahzubairy/) for providing the Matlab code before the publication of their 
[paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/696277). 

I greatly benefitted from the helpful remarks by Jon [Danielsson](https://www.systemicrisk.ac.uk/people/jon-danielsson) and the profound *R*, *Rcpp* and *GitHub* knowledge of Philipp [Wittenberg](https://github.com/wittenberg) and Detlef (overflow) [Steuer](https://github.com/dsteuer).
Last but not least, I am grateful to Philipp Dybowski without whom I would have never started this project.

All remaining errors are obviously mine.
